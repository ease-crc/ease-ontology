\chapter{Requirements}
A good idea would be to have here a table with all requirements which we want to achieve with NEEMs.
I assume it will be a nice overview for the reader(partner), if they will open the document, they can see right away what feature is supported by the current NEEM version, which are planned for the next version and which will be added in the late future. We can create the requirement table based on the EASE proposal.\todo{Seba: Good idea but I would wait until the whole document is finished.}
