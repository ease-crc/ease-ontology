\subsection{Summary}
	\label{ch:example}
	This section provided you the fundamentals, how you can utilize the \soma ontology and \cram to create your own \neems. Under the following link (\url{https://neemgit.informatik.uni-bremen.de/neems/ease-2020-pr2-setting-up-table}), you can download some robot \neems to have an overview of a generated \neem.
									
%	This log file represents an experiment where the \pr tired to grasp five objects which were located on a kitchen counter and bring each object to our table and place them there.
%	We defined grasping + placing as a transporting.
%	This experiment was performed in projection meaning in simulation.
%	\cram is not used using a belief state during execution in projection, therefore we will not show how a belief state is represented.
%	The object which were perceived or grasped are represented as strings.
%	
%	Figure \ref{fig:actionExample} show how a transporting task for a cup is represented.
%	To summarize what happened during the transporting task in the experiment,
%	The task was performed not successfully in projection. 
%	The failure was that the cup was unfetchable for the \pr.
%	The \pr used the left arm to grasp the cup from a connected space region and transported to object to a specific pose in the map.
%	\todo{How we can differ between those two goal Locations ?}
%	This task has also one sub action. 
%	Given the task the agent inferred that to achieve this task, it has to perform a PickingUpAnObject task.
%	You can also read from the log that the \pr2 tried already an transporting task on another object and that this task is also not the last transporting task.

%	The next transporting represented in \dots \ref{fig:actionExample2} represents a transporting task of a bowl object.
%	In contrast to the previous task, this task was successfully performed.
%	Again the \pr used only the left arm.
%	The \pr grasped the object from a connected space region which is an kitchen counter \ref{fig:connectedSpaceRegion}.
%	It placed the object in the specific pose in the map which is displayed in \ref{fig:pose} \todo{Abhijit: missing Figure labels}.
