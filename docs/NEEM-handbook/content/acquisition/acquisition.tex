\chapter{NEEM-Acquisition}
\label{ch:acquisition}
\chapterauthor{S. Koralewski, A. Hawkin}

This chapter focuses on the acquisition process of \neems.
At first, we will provide the tools and procedures to acquire episodic memories from robots performing experiments.
The second section focuses on the \neem acquisition from virtual reality. 

%Each section will contain an example \neem to provide insights on, how the representation, described in the chapters \ref{ch:background}, \ref{ch:narrative} and \ref{ch:experience} is utilized to capture performed activities by robots or by humans. 
%In addition, each example \neem is available on the \neemhub for downloading.



\section{Data Structure}

We are using MongoDB to capture the data structures of the \neems.
If you will use the \knowrob interface to create your \neems then your \neem will consist of at least 3 folders - \textit{annotations}, \textit{inferred} and \textit{triples}.
The \neemnar and \neemexp are stored as a collection of BSON \footnote{http://bsonspec.org/faq.html} files.
Each folder should contain a BSON file and metafile stored as JSON.
Each generated \neem stores also the complete state of the \soma ontology which was used during the acquisition process.
The benefit of this is that while loading a \neem, it is not required to keep track to load the correct \soma version.
In the following, we will give an overview which information is contained in those folders generated by \knowrob:


\begin{description}
	\item[\textbf{annotations}] The annotations collection contains annotations(comments) which are asserted to the concepts of the ontology.
	\item[\textbf{inferred}] The inferred collection contains triples which were inferred and not asserted during the logging process. Inference processes can be triggered when triples are asserted directly to the knowledge base.
	\item[\textbf{triples}] The triples collection contains all triples which were asserted into the knowledge base during run time.
